# **GMarket**

GMarket is a website that showcases various products such as clothing, shoes, jewelry, and bags. This website was created by the developer to enhance their React skills. As a result, the developer did not create an independent database; instead, they utilized an external API. The API in use is the **[Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/)**, which provides products, carts, and user data in JSON format. For convenient styling, the Chakra-UI component-based library, React Icons for the icon and Tailwind CSS framework were employed.

## **What I Learned**

Through the development of this fairly complex program, I gained experience in applying my understanding of React Redux, which I had previously studied **[here](https://github.com/urvangibran/biodata-app-fe)**. This involved practicing the use of reducers, stores, useDispatch, useSelector, and more. Challenges in the project development included dealing with numerous components and data that needed careful consideration. Occasionally, component naming posed difficulties, resulting in errors due to imprecise naming choices.

This project also marked my first attempt at crafting a website with my own design using Figma, as I had just started learning how to use it. Also, you can check this design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ZEmaahaR7GcI61oa0JeUeM/GMarket?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design)

## Some important notes from this project are:

1. Precision in component naming is crucial.
2. Planning for the website's appearance and features needs thorough consideration beforehand to avoid confusion during development.
3. File structure planning also demands attention, as it simplifies the development process.
